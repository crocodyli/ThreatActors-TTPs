  "description": "[Deep Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009) is a suspected Chinese threat group known to target many industries, including government, defense, financial, and telecommunications. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014) The intrusion into healthcare company Anthem has been attributed to [Deep Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009). (Citation: ThreatConnect Anthem) This group is also known as Shell Crew, WebMasters, KungFu Kittens, and PinkPanther. (Citation: RSA Shell Crew) [Deep Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009) also appears to be known as Black Vine based on the attribution of both group names to the Anthem intrusion. (Citation: Symantec Black Vine) Some analysts track [Deep Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009) and [APT19](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073) as the same group, but it is unclear from open source information if the groups are the same.
