# Ransomware BlackSuit

The ransomware landscape has remained active since 2024, with various ransomware groups targeting a wide range of organizations. In this context, the BlackSuit ransomware has emerged as a significant cyber threat due to its data encryption and extortion operations.

BlackSuit is a type of malicious software classified as ransomware. Its operation involves multifaceted extortion, encrypting and exfiltrating victim data, and hosting public data leak sites for victims who fail to meet its demands. BlackSuit’s activities first began in early May 2023. Designed to prevent access to files by encrypting them, this ransomware appends the “.blacksuit” extension to the names of all affected files. Furthermore, it changes the desktop wallpaper and creates a ransom note file named “README.BlackSuit.txt.”

This threat actor targets large corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with no apparent specific discrimination regarding industry or type of victim.
