# Ransomware 3AM

A new Ransomware family identified by the name "3AM" or "ThreeAM" in September 2023. The ransomware operation was observed by the Symantec team, in which a ransomware affiliate attempted to deploy another ransomware, LockBit, on the target network and then switched to 3AM when LockBit was reportedly blocked.

The ransomware operation, according to the publication on its Tor-based website, has been operating since mid-August 2023, according to the publication from its first victim.

The said ransomware was only identified due to its use in a cyberattack resulting in the encryption of some files on the victim's network, which was reported by Symantec.
