# ShinyHunters

**ShinyHunters** is one of the most resilient and prolific cybercrime groups of the decade, known for being an elite "data broker" that evolved into large-scale extortion operations. Unlike groups that focus only on encryption, ShinyHunters' DNA lies in **massive database theft** and **cloud/SaaS infrastructure intrusion**.

In 2025 and early 2026, the group consolidated its position by leading the **Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters** coalition, joining forces with Scattered Spider and LAPSUS$ remnants.

## History and Evolution

| Period | Event |
|--------|-------|
| **2020** | Gained fame by breaching Microsoft's GitHub repositories and leaking data from giants like Tokopedia and Wattpad. |
| **BreachForums Era** | Visceral connection with BreachForums. After administrator arrests (like "Pompompurin"), ShinyHunters took control of the platform in various reincarnations, using it to auction databases. |
| **Snowflake Campaign (2024)** | Main architects (along with UNC5537) of the campaign that compromised hundreds of Snowflake customers (Ticketmaster, Santander, AT&T), focusing on credential stuffing and lack of MFA. |
| **2025 Merger** | Created the "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters" brand, combining ShinyHunters' data reach with Scattered Spider's social engineering (vishing) techniques. |

## Operational Model

- **Specialization**: Identity-based exfiltration, rarely using traditional malware
- **Communication Style**: "Polished" and corporate ransom notes, treating extortion as a "mutual opportunity to solve a security problem"
- **Data Handling**: Rarely destroy data; their model is steal, extort, and if not paid, sell

## Coalition Partners

- **Scattered Spider**: Social engineering and vishing expertise
- **LAPSUS$ Remnants**: Aggressive tactics and public exposure
- **UNC5537**: Cloud infrastructure compromise
