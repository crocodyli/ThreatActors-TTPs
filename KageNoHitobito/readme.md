# Ransomware KageNoHitobito  
Some samples of a ransomware variant known as KageNoHitobito were identified in mid-March 2024. Like other types of ransomware, this variant encrypts data on victims' machines and demands a ransom to decrypt them through ransom notes.
Although the group mentioned its existence and activities on the Tor network, no activities or a Data Leak Site (DLS) were identified on the said network.
There is no additional information about the initial infection method used by the threat actor, but it appears that the sample was made available for testing in sandbox services to identify the maliciousness of the file. Potentially, it may have been distributed through fake software or game cheats.
After encrypting the data, the payload appends the '.hibito' extension to the end of the files, as shown in the following image.
