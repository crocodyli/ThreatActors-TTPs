# THREAT ACTORS AND RANSOMWARES - TTPs

This repository was created with the aim of assisting **companies** and **independent researchers** in studying the **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**, based on the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework, adopted by active or inactive **Ransomware operators/groups** and other **Threat Actors**.

This content includes TTP mapping, the **history of activities**, and the record of exploited **CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**. Furthermore, I am including data on **commands**, **tools**, and **useful locations for researching artifacts** in the DFIR/CTI field.

The primary focus is to offer a summary of each actor's **trajectory**, providing essential information that can be utilized by security organizations and individual researchers.

## COLLABORATION AND DATA SHARING

This project relies on contributions from various researchers in the community. The data collected here is also intended to serve as a resource for other security projects, such as **RANSOMWARE.LIVE** (accessible at: https://www.ransomware.live/), fostering a wider collaboration ecosystem.
