# Ransomware Group 0mega

The 0mega (or Omega) Ransomware Group is a threat entity that emerged in the threat landscape, notable for adopting the Double Extortion model and focusing on large organizations (Big Game Hunting), particularly in the healthcare, education, manufacturing, and financial services sectors.

To date, the group is primarily referenced as the 0mega or Omega Ransomware Group in security analyses. There is no widely accepted nomenclature or codename used by other security companies (such as Mandiant, CrowdStrike, or Microsoft) that significantly differs from its primary name, which indicates it operates with a consistent brand identity.
