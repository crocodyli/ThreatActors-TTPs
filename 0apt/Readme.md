The **0apt** ransomware group (also spelled **ZeroAPT** in some intelligence communities) is one of the most technical and stealthy actors that has recently emerged, gaining notoriety between late 2024 and early 2026. Unlike "noisy" groups like LockBit, 0apt focuses on **surgical operations against high-value targets**.

## History and Profile

0apt initially emerged as an **industrial espionage group** that "pivoted" to ransomware as a form of monetization and anti-forensics cover.
