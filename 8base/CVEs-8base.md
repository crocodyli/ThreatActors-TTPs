# Vulnerabilities Exploited — 8Base Ransomware Group

| **CATEGORY** | **DETAILS** |
|:---:|:---|
| **General Overview** | Intelligence sources from **2024–2025** indicate that **8Base** does **not focus on exploiting specific vulnerabilities** (0-day or high-profile N-day exploits). Instead, the group targets **weak security controls** and **unpatched Windows systems** vulnerable to common exploitation techniques (MITRE: **T1203 – Exploitation for Client Execution**). |
| **Primary Initial Access Methods** | 
| **1. Social Engineering / Human Factor** | Conducts **phishing campaigns via email** to steal credentials or gain an initial foothold in corporate networks. Often relies on user interaction rather than technical exploits. |
| **2. Outdated Systems** | Seeks **unprotected or poorly maintained hosts** running outdated Windows versions. Exploits **known vulnerabilities** that remain unpatched, leveraging default configurations and weak system hardening. |
| **3. Weak or Reused Credentials** | Actively searches for **administrator accounts** or credentials that are weak, reused, or stored insecurely. Employs **privilege escalation** techniques after gaining access. |
| **Group Classification** | The **8Base** group is better described as exploiting **poor security hygiene** (lack of patching, weak configurations, and insufficient segmentation) rather than specific CVEs. It operates opportunistically against organizations with **misconfigurations and outdated defenses**. |
