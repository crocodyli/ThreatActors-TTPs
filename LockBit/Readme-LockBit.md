# **LockBit**
The LockBit Ransomware group began its operations in mid-2019 under the name Ransomware ABCD and has since been evolving and improving its malicious code and infrastructure. The group operates a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation, which started in mid-2020 in conjunction with the release of the new variant known as LockBit2.0 or LockBit Red.
The malicious actor behind the group goes by the persona LockBitSupp on Dark Web forums (XSS), exhibiting extremely narcissistic and egocentric behavior. Over the years of operation, they have consistently defamed other ransomware groups and sought to promote their own operation.
In mid-2022, a new variant of the ransomware was announced as LockBit3.0 or LockBit Black due to the hiring of the former developer from the DarkSide (Ransomware BlackMatter) malicious actors. Additionally, the same developer leaked a LockBit Ransomware builder in September 2022, making it available for other threat actors to use in creating other groups.
Another noteworthy fact is that the ransomware operator is constantly announcing and seeking people for their operation, whether to assist with infrastructure, develop new features, or even to verify the quality of their "products". For example, I found evidence of a hiring for a "tester" during research on the Dark Web.
