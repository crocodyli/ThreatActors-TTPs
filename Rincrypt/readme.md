# Ransomware Rincrypt

As the ransomware landscape becomes increasingly accessible to threat actors, along with the emergence of new ransomware groups, this report will address Rincrypt Ransomware, which has been observed to be a variant of Chaos Ransomware.

It is worth noting that after encryption, the ransomware appends four random characters to the names of encrypted files, also changing the desktop wallpaper and creating a ransom note file named “READ THIS.txt.”

A clear example of the ransomware making changes is when it renames files like "1.jpg" to "1.jpg.e49f" or "2.png" to "2.png.fwyt."

It is worth noting that the ransom note for this variant includes instructions for the victim to contact the address parig47317@iliken.com to acquire the ransomware decryptor.
