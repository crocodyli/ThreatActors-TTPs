# Ransomware Fsociety-Flocker

A new variant emerged in mid-May 2024 and continues to operate, harming various organizations over the months. This variant is named "Fsociety-Flocker" and hosts its "data leak site" (DLS) on the onion network, as well as having a Telegram announcement channel.

In addition to these platforms, the threat actor has been observed on a forum used by the cyber community, announcing its Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) program. The forum is known as Cybernulled.

Unfortunately, there are still no details about the tactics, techniques, or procedures (TTPs) used by the group, nor about the initial access methods to organizations. However, methods such as exploiting vulnerabilities, purchasing credentials from IABs (Initial Access Brokers), and phishing techniques are common among such cybercriminals.

Before discussing any investigation about the group, it is worth mentioning the origin of the name "Fsociety." Over the years, various groups have adopted this name, making it challenging to correlate all these activities due to information limitations.

The name "Fsociety" was mentioned in the series Mr. Robot, representing a group of hackers who carried out several cyberattacks against organizations in the series, acting as hacktivists. Since then, the series and this group's name have inspired real-life hacking activities, as we will observe throughout this report.

Additionally, according to investigations, the threat actor in question may be based in countries using Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), as the actor reportedly had a specific clock on their devices set to this time zone, as well as matching the date and time of posts on the forum.
