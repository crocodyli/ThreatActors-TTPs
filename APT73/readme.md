# Ransomware APT73
A new ransomware group is said to have emerged in mid-April 2024, under the name "APT73." It's worth noting that the group reportedly self-proclaimed as an APT, which stands for "Advanced Persistent Threat" in the cybersecurity field.
According to research, much of the available information about the aforementioned group came from another ransomware group known as LockBit. This is evident as the group, on its Data Leak Site (DLS) website, added pages such as "Contact Us," "How to buy Bitcoin," "Web Security Bug Bounty," and "Mirrors."

Another relevant fact is that this group is also known as Ransomware Eraleig. This is because the group allegedly used a domain in the past to disclose information about victims. There is no information available about any Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures associated with this ransomware group, nor about the latest artifacts used for encryption purposes.
In the analysis conducted on the aforementioned website and the infrastructure used by the group, it was possible to identify that the site, which operates on the Tor network (http[:]//wn6vonooq6fggjdgyocp7bioykmfjket7sbp47cwhgubvowwd7ws5pyd[.]onion/), appears to be hosted in the Czech Republic.

The AS9009 used in hosting has been associated with various malicious groups, such as DarkAngels, Vice Society, and other ransomware groups that used the ASN for hosting their DLS websites. Additionally, other malware has been identified as using the ASN for communication, including TrickBot, Meduza Stealer, Rimasuta, among others.
As mentioned earlier, there isn't much evidence related to the activities of this group, only details of their infrastructure for disclosing potential victims.
Information about the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of the group has not yet been collected. Once collected, it will be made available soon.
