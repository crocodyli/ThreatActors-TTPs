  "description": "[Rocke](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0106) is an alleged Chinese-speaking adversary whose primary objective appeared to be cryptojacking, or stealing victim system resources for the purposes of mining cryptocurrency. The name [Rocke](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0106) comes from the email address \"rocke@live.cn\" used to create the wallet which held collected cryptocurrency. Researchers have detected overlaps between [Rocke](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0106) and the Iron Cybercrime Group, though this attribution has not been confirmed.(Citation: Talos Rocke August 2018)",
