| **Access Type / Vulnerability** | **Exploitation Description** |
|---|---|
| Compromised SaaS Credentials | The group achieved initial access by compromising credentials of a Microsoft SaaS global administrator account that was weakly protected. |
| RDP Exploitation | A common (though not exclusive) tactic is exploiting insecure remote access (RDP) and technical vulnerabilities on outdated systems. |
| Misconfigured Settings | The exploitation of weak SaaS credentials indicates 0mega benefits from poor security configurations and lack of strict access controls (e.g., missing MFA) in cloud environments. |
