# AlphaLocker Ransomware
The **AlphaLocker** ransomware group emerged around **mid-2023**, quickly evolving in its tactics and adopting the **Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)** model. Below is a concise overview of its development and current activity.
## Emergence and Early Phase (2023)
- **May 2023:** The first references to “Alpha” appeared, identified through a **TOX ID** linked to a threat actor.  
- **Low Initial Sophistication:** Early ransom notes were basic and sometimes didn’t even mention the name “Alpha.” Encrypted files used random numeric extensions, suggesting the group was still in its early stages of organization.
## Brand and Tactics Consolidation (June – November 2023)
- **June 2023:** The group started using the name **“Alpha Locker”** in ransom notes, marking the start of a branding effort.  
- **November 2023:** The name evolved to **“Alpha Ransomware”**, showing more maturity and refinement.  
- **File Extensions:** The group replaced numeric extensions with **8-character alphanumeric strings**, indicating greater technical sophistication and consistency.
## Operation Model and Current Activity (2024 – 2025)
- **RaaS Model:** AlphaLocker operates as a **Ransomware as a Service**, offering affiliates access to the ransomware, admin panel, and decryption keys, enabling other threat actors to launch attacks without developing the code themselves.  
- **Double Extortion:** Besides encrypting data, the group **steals sensitive information** and threatens to leak it on the **“MYDATA”** leak site, increasing pressure on victims.  
- **Infection Methods:** Propagation occurs mainly via **phishing emails**, **malicious links**, and **exploited vulnerabilities** in unpatched systems.  
- **Increased Activity:** Since early **2025**, activity levels have risen, with **dozens of victims** reported across different sectors.  
- **Attribution:** It is believed the group is operated by **Russian-speaking threat actors**, though limited details are available.
AlphaLocker has evolved from a basic ransomware operation into a structured RaaS model, combining **data encryption** with **public data leaks** to increase leverage. Its steady development and adoption of double extortion tactics have made it an **active and notable threat** in the global cybersecurity landscape.
